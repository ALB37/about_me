        <h3>Bio</h3>
          <p>I was born and raised in New Orleans. I moved to the Pacific Northwest when I was a teenager and currently reside in Seattle. I studied chemistry for a couple years in college before deciding I wasn't a big fan of the career choices. Music has always been a passion of mine, so I switched over to study audio engineering. I graduated with an associate's degree at Shoreline CC and have spent the past few years working in a recording studio in Shoreline.</p>

        <h3>Interests</h3>
          <p>I am what you might call a "creative type." My two current passions are music and photography. I love creating music. I use Ableton Live and a Push to compose music, and a variety of hardware and software synthesizers. I would love to someday build a modular synthesizer. I am fascinated by the possibilities it offers. <br/>I enjoy shooting film and love the look that it gives. I enjoy doing the chemistry and watching the photos appear out of the void. I shoot on a variety of cameras, both film and digital. </p>
